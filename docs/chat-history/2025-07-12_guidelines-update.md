# Session Summary

Repository guidelines in `.ai/prp/default.md` have been revised for generic AI model use, with clear best practices for implementation, testing, code organization, and documentation.

## Highlights
- Both TypeScript and Python examples for branded types, testing, database, and code organization.
- Monorepo and Python repo structure guidance included.
- Explicit instructions for chat history, PRP, and documentation traceability.
- Shortcut commands for workflow and review (QNEW, QPLAN, QCODE, QCHECK, QCHECKF, QCHECKT, QUX, QGIT).

## Action Items
- All future chat sessions and PRP updates should follow the structure and standards in `.ai/prp/default.md`.
- Reference `.ai/prp/default.md` for the latest, language-agnostic coding guidelines and repository process.
