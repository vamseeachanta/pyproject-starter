## Pitch

PyProject-Starter is a comprehensive Python package template that helps developers and teams quickly bootstrap modern Python projects by providing a fully configured cookiecutter template with best practices for package development, testing, and deployment.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Python Developers**: Individual developers creating new Python packages and libraries
- **Development Teams**: Teams establishing consistent Python project standards across multiple repositories
- **Open Source Contributors**: Contributors creating new open source Python projects with modern tooling

### User Personas

**Senior Python Developer** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Lead Developer / Technical Architect
- **Context:** Creating new Python packages for internal tools or open source projects
- **Pain Points:** Manual project setup, inconsistent tooling across projects, outdated boilerplate code
- **Goals:** Rapid project initialization, modern tooling integration, standardized project structure

**Development Team Lead** (30-50 years old)
- **Role:** Engineering Manager / Technical Lead
- **Context:** Establishing team standards for Python project development
- **Pain Points:** Inconsistent project structures, varying tooling choices, manual setup overhead
- **Goals:** Team standardization, efficient onboarding, maintainable project templates

## The Problem

### Manual Project Setup Overhead

Python developers spend significant time setting up new projects with modern tooling (pytest, black, mypy, pre-commit, CI/CD). This leads to inconsistent project structures, delayed development starts, and varying quality standards across projects.

**Our Solution:** Provide a comprehensive template with all modern Python development tools pre-configured and ready to use.

### Inconsistent Development Standards

Teams often struggle with establishing and maintaining consistent development standards across multiple Python projects. This results in varying code quality, different testing approaches, and maintenance difficulties.

**Our Solution:** Offer a standardized template that enforces best practices and provides consistent tooling across all projects.

### Outdated Python Packaging Practices

Many Python project templates use outdated packaging approaches (setup.py) instead of modern standards (pyproject.toml with PEP 517/518). This leads to compatibility issues and suboptimal build processes.

**Our Solution:** Implement modern Python packaging standards with pyproject.toml, hatchling build backend, and uv support.

## Differentiators

### Modern Python Standards

Unlike older project templates, we use the latest Python packaging standards including pyproject.toml, PEP 517/518 build system, and modern dependency management with uv support. This ensures compatibility with current Python ecosystem best practices.

### Comprehensive Tooling Integration

Unlike basic templates, we provide complete integration of essential development tools: pytest for testing, black/isort for formatting, mypy for type checking, pre-commit for quality gates, and bumpver for version management.

### Production-Ready Configuration

Unlike experimental templates, our configuration is battle-tested with proper coverage reporting, CI/CD integration, documentation setup, and deployment automation ready for production use.
