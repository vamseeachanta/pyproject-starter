> Status: Planning

## Executive Summary

**Prompt for Future Reuse:**
```
Set up buildermethods Agent OS (https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) for this Python package template repository with comprehensive team collaboration features. Execute the following implementation with logical task dependency ordering:

TASK DEPENDENCY ORDERING STANDARD:
- All implementation tasks must follow logical dependency ordering where prior tasks are always applicable (if logical) to subsequent tasks
- Each task builds upon the achievements of previous tasks
- Task dependencies must be explicitly documented

## Overview

Integrate Agent OS development framework into this Python package template repository to enable multi-system team collaboration with trunk-based development, automated Python development workflows, and synchronized sub-agents. This integration will provide structured spec creation, task management, and standardized documentation processes optimized for Python package development teams using modern Python tooling (pyproject.toml, uv, pytest).

## User Stories

### Python Package Development Team Collaboration

As a Python developer working on package templates across multiple systems, I want to use Agent OS with trunk-based development and automated Python development scripts, so that I can collaborate seamlessly with team members while maintaining consistent Python package development workflows and synchronized states using modern Python tooling.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer creates new Python package feature spec using `/create-spec` command
2. The system automatically creates trunk-based git branch for this Python package feature
3. Sub-agents are configured in .agent-os folder for Python development team synchronization
4. Python development scripts automate testing, building, and PyPI publishing tasks
5. All team members work on main branch with feature flags and continuous Python package integration
6. Spec completion automatically merges changes and updates the package development state

### System-Level Agent OS Installation for Python Development

As a Python developer setting up this package template on my system, I want Agent OS to be properly installed at the system level for my operating system with Python development support, so that I can use the framework consistently regardless of whether I'm on Windows, Linux, macOS, or Unix, with all Python development commands and tools properly configured for my environment.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System detects current operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix) and Python environment
2. Downloads and installs appropriate Agent OS system components for the OS with Python integration
3. Configures system-level paths, environment variables, and shell integration for Python development
4. Sets up OS-specific Python development environment and virtual environment management
5. Validates installation with cross-platform compatibility tests including Python package workflows
6. Enables seamless `/create-spec` and other Agent OS commands across all supported platforms with Python development support

### Python Package Template Management

As a maintainer of this Python package template, I want Agent OS to provide multi-system synchronization with standardized spec creation for Python package features, so that distributed team members can work consistently on package template improvements regardless of their development environment while maintaining full traceability of Python development patterns and decisions.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Team member creates Python package feature spec using standardized `/create-spec` process
2. Executive summary captures original prompt for future Python package template reference
3. Mermaid flowcharts visualize Python package development processes and workflow interactions
4. Sub-agents ensure consistent behavior across all team Python development systems
5. Trunk-based development enables continuous integration without branch conflicts for package features
6. Python development automation handles routine testing, building, and publishing tasks

2. **Custom Python Package Spec Templates** - Modified templates that automatically include executive summary sections with reusable prompts and mermaid flowcharts optimized for Python development
3. **Updated Python Development Workflow** - Team can use `/create-spec` command to generate structured specifications that work with Python package development patterns
4. **Logical Task Dependency Framework** - Established pattern of task ordering where each step builds upon previous achievements for maximum efficiency and reduced errors in Python development
5. **Reusable Python Package Implementation Guide** - Complete documentation that enables this setup to be replicated in other Python package repositories

## Future Spec Requirements

**Executive Summary Prompt Completeness Standard**: All specs created using Agent OS must include a complete, self-contained "Prompt for Future Reuse" in the executive summary that:
- Contains all necessary information for any Python development team to implement without external references
- Includes the Task Dependency Ordering Standard as defined below
- Documents all implementation steps with explicit dependencies
- Lists all expected deliverables and outcomes
- Uses generic language (pronouns, common nouns) for repository adaptability
- Provides sufficient context for successful implementation across different Python development environments

**Task Dependency Ordering Standard**: All future specs created using Agent OS must follow the logical dependency ordering principle established in this specification, where:
- Prior tasks are always applicable (if logical) to subsequent tasks
- Each task builds upon the achievements of previous tasks
- Task dependencies are explicitly documented in both the prompt and task sections
- Foundation tasks (like system installation) come before dependent tasks (like analysis or configuration)
- This ordering minimizes errors, reduces rework, and ensures consistent implementation success across different team members and environments
