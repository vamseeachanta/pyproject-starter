# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-31-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-31
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Multi-Platform Installation:** Agent OS framework must install correctly on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Unix systems with Python 3.8+ support
- **Python Package Integration:** System must integrate with existing pyproject.toml structure and modern Python tooling (uv, pytest)
- **Cross-System Synchronization:** Agent OS configurations must synchronize across different development environments and team member systems
- **Template Compatibility:** Spec templates must work with Python package development patterns and workflows
- **Automation Script Support:** System must support OS-specific automation scripts for Python development tasks (testing, building, publishing)
- **Git Workflow Integration:** Trunk-based development workflow must integrate with existing Python package development practices

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Manual Agent OS Installation and Configuration
- Pros: Full control over installation process, custom configuration options
- Cons: Time-intensive setup, potential for configuration errors, difficult to replicate across team

**Option B:** Automated Installation with Template-Specific Configuration (Selected)
- Pros: Consistent installation process, reduced setup time, standardized configuration for Python packages
- Cons: Less flexibility for custom configurations, dependency on automation scripts

**Option C:** Docker-Based Agent OS Environment
- Pros: Complete environment isolation, consistent across all systems
- Cons: Additional Docker complexity, potential performance overhead, limited OS integration

**Rationale:** Option B selected because it provides the optimal balance of consistency, ease of use, and integration with existing Python development workflows while maintaining the flexibility needed for different team member environments.

## External Dependencies

- **buildermethods/agent-os** - Core Agent OS framework from GitHub repository
- **Justification:** Required for structured AI-assisted development workflows and team collaboration features

- **Cross-Platform Shell Support** - Windows PowerShell, Linux/Unix bash, macOS zsh/bash
- **Justification:** Needed for OS-specific automation scripts and consistent command execution across different development environments

- **Python Development Tools** - pyproject.toml, uv, pytest, and modern Python packaging tools
- **Justification:** Required for integration with existing Python package development workflows and maintaining compatibility with current tooling

- **Git Integration** - GitPython or similar for automated git workflow management
- **Justification:** Essential for trunk-based development workflow automation and branch management

## Implementation Architecture

### System-Level Installation
- Agent OS framework installed at system level with Python environment integration
- Cross-platform compatibility layer for different operating systems
- Environment variable and shell integration configuration
- Validation system for installation verification across platforms

### Repository Integration
- .agent-os directory structure optimized for Python package development
- Integration with existing pyproject.toml and package structure
- Configuration files for multi-system team synchronization
- CLAUDE.md setup for AI-assisted development workflow

### Sub-Agent Configuration
- development-agent.md: Python package development patterns and workflows
- testing-agent.md: pytest integration and package validation procedures
- deployment-agent.md: PyPI publishing and package distribution automation
- Cross-system synchronization mechanisms for consistent sub-agent behavior

### Automation Scripts
- create-spec-branch.sh: Automated git branch creation for Python package features
- sync-team-state.sh: Cross-system state synchronization for Python development environments
- merge-spec-completion.sh: Automated merge workflows for completed Python package features
- python-dev-tasks.sh: Common Python development task automation (testing, building, publishing)

### Template System
- Python package-specific spec templates with executive summary requirements
- Mermaid diagram integration for workflow visualization
- Prompt capture mechanism for future reuse and team knowledge sharing
- Template validation system for consistency across Python package development

## Integration Points

### Python Package Development Workflow
- Integration with pyproject.toml structure and modern packaging standards
- Compatibility with virtual environment management and dependency handling
- Support for Python testing frameworks (pytest) and quality assurance tools
- Integration with PyPI publishing workflows and package distribution

### Development Environment Compatibility
- Integration with popular Python IDEs (VSCode, PyCharm, Vim/Neovim)
- Support for different Python environment managers (virtualenv, conda, pyenv)
- Compatibility with various Python development tools and linters
- Cross-platform file system and path handling

### Team Collaboration Features
- Multi-user configuration management and synchronization
- Distributed development environment consistency
- Version control integration for configuration and state management
- Team member onboarding and setup automation

## Performance Considerations

### Installation Performance
- Minimized download and installation time across different platforms
- Efficient validation procedures that don't significantly impact setup time
- Caching mechanisms for repeated installations or updates

### Runtime Performance
- Lightweight automation scripts that don't interfere with Python development workflows
- Efficient synchronization mechanisms that don't slow down development processes
- Optimized template generation and spec creation performance

### Scalability Considerations
- Support for large Python development teams with multiple concurrent users
- Efficient handling of multiple Python package repositories with shared Agent OS configuration
- Scalable synchronization mechanisms that work across distributed teams
