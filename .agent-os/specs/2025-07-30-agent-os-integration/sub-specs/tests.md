# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**Agent OS File Structure**
- Verify .agent-os directory creation with correct structure
- Test template-files directory contains all required Agent OS files
- Validate standards files contain Python-specific configurations

**Template Integration Functions**
- Test template copying functionality preserves file permissions
- Verify template customization scripts work correctly
- Check integration with existing template structure

### Integration Tests

**Template Development Workflow**
- Create test spec using Agent OS in template repository
- Execute task workflow and verify integration with existing Python tooling
- Test Agent OS commands work alongside existing scripts (uv, pytest, etc.)

**New Project Creation Workflow**
- Generate new project from template and verify Agent OS files are copied
- Test Agent OS functionality in newly created project
- Verify Python standards are properly configured for new project

**Existing Tool Compatibility**
- Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions
- Test existing scripts continue to work (publish.sh, release.sh, uv commands)
- Verify pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions remain functional

### Feature Tests

**Complete Agent OS Workflow**
- End-to-end test of spec creation, task execution, and completion
- Test collaborative template maintenance scenario
- Verify template customization by end users

**Template Usage Scenarios**
- Test template works for different Python project types
- Verify Agent OS gracefully handles projects that don't use it
- Test customization of Python standards for different use cases

## Mocking Requirements

- **File System Operations:** Mock during template copying tests to avoid side effects
- **Git Operations:** Mock git commands during Agent OS workflow tests
- **External Dependencies:** Mock any external API calls if Agent OS requires them
