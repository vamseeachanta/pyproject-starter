# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-30-agent-os-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Preserve all existing Python tooling (uv, pyproject.toml, hatchling, pytest, pre-commit)
- Create Agent OS directory structure that coexists with existing documentation structure
- Generate Python-specific Agent OS standards that reflect modern Python best practices
- Template must be usable both with and without Agent OS (graceful degradation)
- Agent OS integration must not interfere with existing scripts (publish.sh, release.sh, etc.)
- Support for both template development workflow and new project initialization workflow

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Minimal Integration - Add only core Agent OS files
- Pros: Simple, non-disruptive, fast implementation
- Cons: Limited functionality, misses opportunity for comprehensive workflow enhancement

**Option B:** Deep Integration with Python-Specific Customization (Selected)
- Pros: Full Agent OS functionality, Python tooling integration, comprehensive workflow support
- Cons: More complex implementation, requires careful coordination with existing tools

**Option C:** Fork Agent OS for Python-specific version
- Pros: Complete control over Python-specific features
- Cons: Maintenance burden, divergence from main Agent OS project

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of functionality and maintainability. It leverages the full power of Agent OS while respecting the existing Python ecosystem tools already configured in the template.

## External Dependencies

- **Agent OS Core Files** - Directory structure and instruction files from buildermethods/agent-os
- **Justification:** Required for Agent OS functionality, no additional Python packages needed

└── src/pyproject_starter/        # Existing: Unchanged
```

### Python Standards Configuration

- Code style standards aligned with existing black, isort, mypy configuration
- Tech stack defaults reflecting uv, pytest, hatchling choices
- Best practices incorporating Python packaging and testing patterns
- Integration with existing pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions

### Template Scaffolding Strategy

1. Keep Agent OS files in separate `template-files/` directory
2. During template usage, copy Agent OS files to new project root
3. Provide customization scripts for users to modify standards
4. Include documentation for Agent OS usage in Python projects

### Workflow Integration Points

- Template versioning using Agent OS decision tracking
- Feature development using Agent OS spec creation
- Code quality maintenance using Agent OS task execution
- User support through Agent OS documentation structure
