  - [ ] 4.3 Create tech-stack.md reflecting uv, pyproject.toml, pytest, and Python packaging ecosystem
  - [ ] 4.4 Create best-practices.md for contemporary Python development patterns
  - [ ] 4.5 Configure standards for seamless integration with template's Python tooling approach
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all standards tests pass

- [ ] 5. Template Integration Architecture Development (Depends on Task 4: Standards must exist before integration)
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for template-files directory creation and management
  - [ ] 5.2 Create template-files/.agent-os/ directory structure for new project inclusion
  - [ ] 5.3 Build template copying mechanisms for Agent OS files to new Python projects
  - [ ] 5.4 Implement customization interface for users to modify Agent OS standards
  - [ ] 5.5 Configure template generation workflow to include Agent OS automatically
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify all integration architecture tests pass

- [ ] 6. Existing Template Documentation Integration (Depends on Task 5: Template architecture required)
  - [ ] 6.1 Write tests for documentation integration
  - [ ] 6.2 Update README.md to include Agent OS usage instructions for template users
  - [ ] 6.3 Add Agent OS workflow documentation to existing docs/ directory structure
  - [ ] 6.4 Ensure documentation clearly separates template development from template usage workflows
  - [ ] 6.5 Verify all documentation integration tests pass

- [ ] 7. Template Usage Workflows Creation (Depends on Task 6: Documentation must be established)
  - [ ] 7.1 Write tests for template copying and customization workflows
  - [ ] 7.2 Build script to copy Agent OS files to new projects during template instantiation
  - [ ] 7.3 Create validation mechanisms for Agent OS setup in newly created Python projects
  - [ ] 7.4 Implement user customization workflows for Agent OS standards in new projects
  - [ ] 7.5 Configure seamless integration between template creation and Agent OS activation
  - [ ] 7.6 Verify all usage workflow tests pass

- [ ] 8. Comprehensive Testing and Validation (Depends on Task 7: All components must be implemented)
  - [ ] 8.1 Run full test suite to ensure no regressions in template functionality
  - [ ] 8.2 Test template development workflow using Agent OS structured approaches
  - [ ] 8.3 Test new project creation with Agent OS included and properly configured
  - [ ] 8.4 Validate existing Python tooling (uv, pytest, pyproject.toml management) continues to work
  - [ ] 8.5 Test customization workflows and user modification of Agent OS standards
  - [ ] 8.6 Verify all comprehensive integration tests pass

- [ ] 9. Documentation and User Training (Depends on Task 8: System must be tested and validated)
  - [ ] 9.1 Write tests for documentation completeness and accuracy
  - [ ] 9.2 Document template development procedures using Agent OS workflows
  - [ ] 9.3 Create user guide for Python developers using template with Agent OS included
  - [ ] 9.4 Provide customization documentation for modifying Agent OS standards in new projects
  - [ ] 9.5 Create migration guide for existing projects to adopt Agent OS from this template
  - [ ] 9.6 Verify all documentation tests pass

## Task Dependency Verification

Each task explicitly documents its dependencies:
- **Task 1**: Foundation task - no dependencies
- **Task 2**: Depends on Task 1 - system installation required to run analysis
- **Task 3**: Depends on Task 2 - analysis results guide foundation setup
- **Task 4**: Depends on Task 3 - foundation structure required for standards creation
- **Task 5**: Depends on Task 4 - standards must exist before template integration
- **Task 6**: Depends on Task 5 - template architecture required before documentation integration
- **Task 7**: Depends on Task 6 - documentation must be established before workflow creation
- **Task 8**: Depends on Task 7 - all components must be implemented before comprehensive testing
- **Task 9**: Depends on Task 8 - system must be tested and validated before documentation

This ordering minimizes errors, reduces rework, and ensures consistent implementation success across different team members and Python template development environments.
