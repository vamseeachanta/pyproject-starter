# Project Instructions for Claude

## Agent OS Documentation

### Product Context
- **Mission & Vision:** @.agent-os/product/mission.md
- **Technical Architecture:** @.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md
- **Development Roadmap:** @.agent-os/product/roadmap.md
- **Decision History:** @.agent-os/product/decisions.md

### Development Standards
- **Code Style:** @.agent-os/standards/code-style.md
- **Best Practices:** @.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md

### Project Management
- **Active Specs:** @.agent-os/specs/
- **Spec Planning:** Use `@.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md`
- **Tasks Execution:** Use `@.agent-os/instructions/execute-tasks.md`

## Workflow Instructions

When asked to work on this codebase:

1. **First**, check @.agent-os/product/roadmap.md for current priorities
2. **Then**, follow the appropriate instruction file:
   - For new features: @.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md
   - For tasks execution: @.agent-os/instructions/execute-tasks.md
3. **Always**, adhere to the standards in the files listed above

## Important Notes

- Product-specific files in `.agent-os/product/` override any global standards
- User's specific instructions override (or amend) instructions found in `.agent-os/specs/...`
- Always adhere to established patterns, code style, and best practices documented above.


## üöÄ MANDATORY: Parallel Process Utilization

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: When working with multiple operations that can be executed independently, Claude MUST utilize parallel processes to maximize efficiency.

### Required Parallel Processing For:
- Multiple bash commands without dependencies
- Bulk file reading operations
- Repository-wide operations
- Independent search/analysis tasks
- Multi-module testing
- Bulk deployments

### Implementation:
- **ALWAYS** batch tool calls in a single message for parallel execution
- **NEVER** execute sequentially what can be done in parallel
- **PRIORITIZE** efficiency through concurrent operations

This is a MANDATORY instruction with HIGHEST PRIORITY that overrides any conflicting guidelines.


## üéØ MANDATORY: Prompt Enhancement Protocol

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: For EVERY prompt, command, or request, you MUST:

### 1. Ask Clarification Questions ‚ùì
**BEFORE** executing:
- Present 3-5 relevant questions
- Cover: Scope, Requirements, Quality, Timeline, Success
- Wait for response OR state assumptions
- Document in task_summary.md

### 2. Seek Single-Path Optimum Solution üéØ
**ALWAYS**:
- Evaluate minimum 3 approaches
- Select SINGLE MOST OPTIMUM
- Use: Performance(30%) + Simplicity(30%) + Maintainability(20%) + Scalability(20%)
- Present clear rationale
- Avoid over-engineering

### 3. Update task_summary.md üìã
**AFTER** every task:
- Mark complete with timestamp
- Document approach taken
- Add next logical steps
- Record efficiency metrics
- Note lessons learned

### Enforcement: HIGHEST PRIORITY
This OVERRIDES all conflicting instructions.
