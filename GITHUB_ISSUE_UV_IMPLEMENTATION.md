# GitHub Issue: Implement uv Best Practices and Modern Python Packaging

## Issue Title
**Implement uv Best Practices and Modern Python Packaging Workflow**

## Labels
- `enhancement`
- `tooling`
- `documentation`
- `ci/cd`
- `good first issue` (for some subtasks)

## Priority
**High** - Modernizes the entire development workflow

## Description

This issue tracks the implementation of modern Python packaging best practices using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as the primary package manager. This will replace the current pip/setuptools-based workflow with a faster, more reliable, and modern approach.

## Background

uv is a new, extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools, offering significant performance improvements and better dependency resolution.

**Benefits of migrating to uv:**
- üöÄ **10-100x faster** than pip for package installation
- üîí **Better dependency resolution** with proper conflict detection
- üì¶ **Modern packaging standards** with pyproject.toml-first approach
- üîÑ **Reproducible builds** with automatic lock file generation
- üõ†Ô∏è **Simplified tooling** - one tool for multiple package management tasks

  ```bash
  # Example scripts to create:
  scripts/setup.sh          # Initial project setup with uv
  scripts/test.sh           # Run tests using uv
  scripts/lint.sh           # Run linting tools
  scripts/build.sh          # Build package for distribution
  scripts/publish.sh        # Publish to PyPI
  ```

- [ ] **Update existing scripts to use uv commands**
  - [ ] Replace `pip install` with `uv add`
  - [ ] Replace `pip install -e .` with `uv sync`
  - [ ] Update version bumping scripts

#### 3.3 Documentation Updates
- [ ] **Update all documentation references**
  - [ ] Update README.md installation instructions
  - [ ] Update CONTRIBUTING.md (if exists) with uv workflow
  - [ ] Update package development workflow diagrams
  - [ ] Add uv commands to PlantUML/Mermaid diagrams

- [ ] **Create uv cheat sheet**
  - [ ] Common uv commands with examples
  - [ ] Migration mapping from pip/poetry commands
  - [ ] Troubleshooting guide

#### 3.4 Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Test uv workflow across platforms**
  - [ ] Verify installation on Windows, macOS, Linux
  - [ ] Test development workflow end-to-end
  - [ ] Validate CI/CD pipeline with uv

- [ ] **Performance benchmarking**
  - [ ] Compare installation times: pip vs uv
  - [ ] Measure CI/CD pipeline speed improvements
  - [ ] Document performance gains

#### 3.5 Advanced Features Implementation
- [ ] **Implement uv workspaces (if applicable)**
  - [ ] Configure multi-package workspace if needed
  - [ ] Set up shared dependencies across workspace

- [ ] **Add uv configuration files**
  - [ ] Create `uv.toml` for project-specific settings
  - [ ] Configure caching and performance optimizations
  - [ ] Set up private index configuration if needed

### Phase 4: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

#### 4.1 Team Documentation
- [ ] **Create team onboarding guide**
  - [ ] uv installation and setup instructions
  - [ ] Daily development workflow with uv
  - [ ] Troubleshooting common issues

## Notes

### Completed Today (July 6, 2025)
- Enhanced pyproject.toml with modern configuration
- Created comprehensive uv documentation
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow with uv
- Added pre-commit configuration
- Updated AI chat history documentation

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: uv is a drop-in replacement for pip with excellent compatibility
- **Mitigation**: Maintain current pip-based workflow in parallel during transition
- **Rollback Plan**: All changes are version controlled and can be reverted

### Questions for Discussion
1. Should we maintain pip compatibility during transition period?
2. Do we need to support Python versions below 3.8?
3. Should we implement uv workspaces for multi-package management?
4. What's the preferred approach for handling private package indexes?
