## Review Focus Areas


### Code Quality Checklist

- Type hints on all functions and classes
- Pydantic v2 models for data validation
- No print() statements (use logging)
- Proper error handling
- Following PEP 8
- Docstrings following Google style


### Pydantic v2 Patterns

- Use `ConfigDict` not `class Config`
- Use `field_validator` not `@validator`
- Use `model_dump()` not `dict()`
- Use `Annotated` types where appropriate


### Security

- Input validation on all endpoints
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Passwords properly hashed
- No hardcoded secrets
- Run `pip-audit` or `safety` for dependency checks


### Structure

- Unit tests co-located with code in `tests/`
- Each feature self-contained (models, service, tools)
- Shared components only for multi-feature use
- Future improvements (e.g., multiple AI providers) in `src/shared/ai_providers/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`


### Linting & Automation

- Run `ruff check --fix` and `mypy`
- Use pre-commit hooks for linting/formatting


### Testing

- New code has tests
- Edge cases covered
- Mock external dependencies
- Run `pytest --cov` for coverage


### Performance

- No N+1 queries
- Efficient algorithms


### Reporting

- Summarize findings in markdown
- Link to relevant docs/standards
- Prioritize issues (high/medium/low)
- Proper async usage


### Documentation

1. Clear README with setup instructions
2. CLAUDE.md is up to date with any new important utils, dependencies etc for future Claude code instances
